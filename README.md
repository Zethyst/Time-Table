<h1 align="center">Time Table</h1>
<p style="font-style:italic;">An interactive responsive appealing polished scheduler website (designed as a reference to my own second semester online time table of google meets of different subjects). Also added some easter eggs and socials/useful links as a bonus. This website has been made to make the user's stay, worthwhile.</p>
